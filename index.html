        Hi, I'm Aria Haghighi! I go by <code>aria42</code> wherever I can get the username.

      <p>
        I've been a machine learning and engineering leader at Facebook and Twitter. I've also worked with
        some of the folks at startup studio. Even earlier, I was co-founder and CTO of <a

        In a previous life, I was an academic computer scientist in statistical natural language processing and machine
        learning, who published award-winning research at ML and NLP conferences. Check out my <a
