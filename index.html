        Hi, I'm Aria Haghighi! I go by <code>aria42</code> wherever I can get the username.

      <p>
        I've been data science and engineering leader at
        <link href="https://amperity.com">Amperity</a>, Facebook, and Apple. I've also worked with
        some of the folks at startup studio <a href="http://psl.com">Pioneer Square Labs</a> and was an entrpreneur in
        residence with
        the <a href="http://allenai.org">Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>.
        Prior to Apple, I was co-founder and CTO of <a
          href="https://slate.com/technology/2013/07/the-worlds-smartest-news-reader-prismatic-has-solved-one-of-the-internets-oldest-problems.html">Prismatic</a>.
        In a previous life, I was an academic computer scientist in statistical natural language processing and machine
        learning, who published award-winning research at ML and NLP conferences. Check out my <a
          href="academic">academic papers</a> and vastly out of date <a href="pubs/cv.pdf">CV</a>!
