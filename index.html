      Hi, I'm Aria! I go by <code>aria42</code> wherever I can get the username.

      <p>
      I'm currently a senior manager at <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> working on none of your business. Before that, I was co-founder and CTO of <a href="http://getprismatic.com">Prismatic</a>.
Before even that, I was an academic computer scientist in statistical natural language processing and machine learning. Check out my <a href="academic">academic papers</a> and vastly out of date <a href="pubs/cv.pdf">CV</a>!
